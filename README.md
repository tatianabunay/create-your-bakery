# create-your-bakery
Deployment: https://create-your-bakery.onrender.com/
A full-stack MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) web application that allows users to create a bakery webpage with the ability to add, update, and delete their own products.
Credits to https://github.com/burakorkmez. I was able to create this full-stack MERN application through his tutorial. However, I did update the code to adhere to Chakra UI 3.25 instead of Chakra v2, which required changing a lot of the components used in the code and the structure these components had to follow. Instead of the original Product Store web application, I also adapted the code's purpose to be for the user to create their own bakery with their own bakery products.
